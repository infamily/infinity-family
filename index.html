<p><span class="en">Infinity Family is a group of individuals and organizations, that collectively work on the <a href="https://github.com/infamily">Infinity Project</a> - an initiative to enable humanity to collectively and systematically define and pursue goals. Our hypothesis is that by automation of creation and integration of <b>meta-languages and ontologies</b> (such as the WikiData, FOAF, The Gene Ontology, the <a href="http://wefindx.net/">equation model ontology</a>, etc.) and <b>data formats</b> (such as RDF, JSON-LD, YAML, etc.) via an invention such as <a href="https://book.mindey.com/metaformat/0001-metaform-philosophy/0001-metaform-philosophy.html">metaformats</a> with modern P2P and cryptographic technologies, and creating a blockchain-based work results (assets) and time recording system, we could enable humanity to systematically define conditions to optimize for <a href="https://mindey.com/shots/fxy.mp4">with arbitrary programs with respect to arbitrary objects</a>, and <a href="https://wefindx.org/static/media/oo.mp4">make know-how accessible</a>.</span></p>
<span class="zh">这里会有<a href="https://github.com/infamily/infinity-family#infinity-family">无界家庭</a>的描述。<a href="https://wefindx.org/static/media/in.mp4">看视频</a>。</span></p>

<p><span class="en">The structure of the organization of Infinity Family is designed to reflect our multi-faceted world, and is designed to allow every jurisdiction to independently run its software on servers within that jurisdiction, meanwhile, allowing for ease of automatic integration of Internet's <b>data and services</b> for collective decisions.</span></p>

<p><span class="en">We rely on the core infrastructure of the Internet, international and local law, and derive our structure via signing membership agreements (entering a treaty) to be the Infinity Family <b>backbone organizations</b>, and collectively run distributed software to provide an infrastructure for such collaboration.</span></p>
