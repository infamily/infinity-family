<p><span class="en">Infinity Family is a group of individuals and organizations, that collectively work on the <a href="https://github.com/infamily">Infinity Project</a> - an initiative to enable humanity collectively and systematically define and pursue goals. Our bet is that by integrating meta-vocabulary (such as <a href="http://wefindx.net/">equation model</a>) and a meta-languages (via an invention such as <a href="https://book.mindey.com">metaformat</a>) with modern P2P and cryptographic technologies, and creating a blockchain-based work results and time recording system, we could enable humanity to systematically define conditions to optimize for, and <a href="https://wefindx.org/static/media/oo.mp4">make know-how accessible</a>.</span></p>
<span class="zh">这里会有<a href="https://github.com/infamily/infinity-family#infinity-family">无界家庭</a>的描述.</span></p>

<p><span class="en">The structure of the organization of Infinity Family is designed to reflect our multi-faceted world, and is designed to allow every jurisdiction to independently run its software on servers within that jurisdiction, meanwhile, allowing for ease of automatic data integration of data for collective decisions.</span></p>

<p><span class="en">We rely on the core infrastructure of the Internet, namely, domain names. Each user is identified by their username in their organization by the e-mail address, and sign membership agreements with one more more of the <b>backbone organizations</b>, which collectively run distributed software to provide an infrastructure for such collaboration.</span></p>
