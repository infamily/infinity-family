# Infinity Family

Infinity Family is a group of individuals and organizations, that collectively work on the Infinity Project.

The structure of organization is designed to reflect our multi-faceted world, and is designed to allow every jurisdiction to independently run its software on servers within that jurisdiction, meanwhile, allowing for ease of automatic data integration of data for collective decisions.

We rely on the core infrastructure of the Internet, namely, domain names. Each user is identified by their username in their organization by the e-mail address, and sign membership agreements with one more more of the **backbone organizations**.

If a specific organization or individual registers membership with more than one backbone organization, then all the data, including user registration, is synchronized across the servers run by these backbone organizations.

For example, if we have a company `Hello World, Inc.` in the U.S., which has domain `helloworld.com, wonderworld.org`, and it signs membership agreement with `Global Mind Share, Inc.` (a backbone organization), by paying a yearly fee, then all users, whose e-mail address ends with domains (`@helloworld.com, @wonderworld.org`) get the right to log-in to the servers run by `Global Mind Share, Inc.`. On the other hand, if `Hello World, Inc.` decides to, on behalf of at least one of the same domain names (e.g., `helloworld.com`), to sign up for a membership agreement with `WeFindX Foundation CLG` , which is an backbone organization in Ireland that runs servers in Europe, then all the content that is created by the users with e-mail addresses ending with `@helloworld.com` are synchronized among the servers of these backbone organizations.
